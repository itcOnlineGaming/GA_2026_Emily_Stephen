# Game Analytics Report: Player Speed Impact on Survival
**Combined Analysis - Stephen & Emily**

## Hypothesis
**If we increase player speed too much, then the player will be hard to control, because enemies are randomized and hard to predict.**

## Experimental Design

### Variables
- **Independent Variable (Condition B):** Player Speed
- **Dependent Variable (Condition A):** Score (survival time)
- **Control:** Enemy spawn rate, enemy behavior, game mechanics

### Test Conditions
- **Baseline Speed:** 400 units
- **Moderate Speed:** 600 units
- **High Speed:** 1000 units

### Combined Results Across All Sessions

| Speed Condition | Number of Games | Mean Score | Min Score | Max Score |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 400 units       | 25              | 10.96      | 0         | 38        |
| 600 units       | 10              | 10.50      | 2         | 29        |
| 1000 units      | 16              | 7.88       | 1         | 18        |

### Individual Participant Performance

#### Stephen's Results
| Speed | Games | Best Score |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 400   | 14    | 38         |
| 1000  | 10    | 18         |

#### Emily's Results
| Speed | Games | Best Score |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 400   | 11    | 20         |
| 600   | 10    | 29         |
| 1000  | 6     | 16         |

## Results

### Key Findings

1. **Minimal Difference Between 400 and 600 Speed**
   - Speed 400 mean: 10.96 points
   - Speed 600 mean: 10.50 points
   - **Observation confirmed:** 600 speed showed "not enough of a tangible difference" from baseline

2. **Significant Performance Decrease at 1000 Speed**
   - Speed 1000 mean: 7.88 points
   - **Observation confirmed:** "Player moving too quickly to safely and reliably dodge random enemies"

4. **Maximum Achievement Scores**
   - Speed 400: **38 points** (Stephen, game 12)
   - Speed 600: **29 points** (Emily, game 18)
   - Speed 1000: **18 points** (Stephen, game 23)
   - Decline in maximum achievable score as speed increases

## Analysis

### Hypothesis Confirmation
The hypothesis is **STRONGLY SUPPORTED** by combined data from both participants:

**Speed 400 vs 600:** As predicted, the difference was "not enough to be tangible" - only 4.2% difference in average performance. This suggests 600 is still within the controllable range but offers no clear advantage.

**Speed 1000:** The data confirms that "player moving too quickly to safely and reliably dodge random enemies":
- 28% performance decrease from baseline
- Maximum score cut in half (38 → 18)
- Consistent decline across both participants
